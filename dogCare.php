            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                As a dog owner, you may adore your pooch as if it were your own flesh and blood. And just like your
                children, you want to ensure you provide the best care possible so your dog can live a happy and healthy
                life. <br>
                If you're striving to be an excellent pet parent, here are some dog care tips to help you along the way.

            <h2 class="header_2_dog_cat_care">
                Meet Your Dog's Basic Needs
            </h2>
            <hr class="line_dog_cat_care">
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                As a dog owner, it's essential to understand and meet your pet's basic needs. Whether you're a novice
                pet parent or an expert, you'll need to set the stage for your new pup. Your dog's basic needs will
                consist of nutritious food, water, treats, toys and bedding to make the pup feel right at home. <br>
                When you bring a new dog into your home, it's best to make a trip to the vet as soon as possible. Your
                vet can help you pinpoint the right type and the amount of food and other important things you need to
                know about caring for your new friend.

            </p>
            <h3 class="header_3_dog_cat_care">
                Monitor food consumption
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                More than one-third (34%) of dogs were diagnosed as obese, according to the most recent data from
                Banfield Pet Hospital, which has more than 1,000 veterinary hospitals in 42 states. That's a 108%
                increase from 2011 to 2020. <br>
                Unfortunately, overweight canines are susceptible to many health risks such as metabolic abnormalities,
                cardiovascular disease or poor immune systems. While you may want to spoil your pet, avoid spoiling them
                with food.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header_3_dog_cat_care">
                Provide sufficient water throughout the day
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                All dogs need to have clean and fresh water available at all times of the day. Make sure to replenish
                the water and wash all food and water dishes so they don't hold bacteria.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header_3_dog_cat_care">
                Regularly groom your dog
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                Regularly grooming your pet ensures they are clean and pest-free. While some dogs only need a bath every
                few months, others need regular grooming. If your dog sheds, you'll want to brush it often. <br>
                Nail trimming is also a must. Neglecting to trim your dog's nails can cause health problems such as
                injured tendons and deformed feet.

                Maintain Your Dog's Health with Routine Care
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                Proactively tending to your pet's well-being and health care ensures it lives the very best and
                healthiest life possible. <br>
                If you have pet insurance, you can usually offset the cost of routine care by adding a wellness package
                to your plan. For example, the average cost of a vet office visit is about $61, according to a Forbes
                Advisor analysis of veterinarian costs, while the average cost for a series of vaccinations (bivalent
                influenza, bordetella, DAPP, leptospirosis, Lyme disease and rabies) costs about $202.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header_3_dog_cat_care">
                Stimulate Your Dog's Brain and Body
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                A balance of physical and mental stimulation plays a significant role in your dog's health. It can also
                encourage good behavior while discouraging harmful behaviors that can wreak havoc on your patience and
                home. <br>
                As the saying goes: A tired dog is a good dog.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header_3_dog_cat_care">
                Train and Bond with Your Dog to Strengthen Your Relationship
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                Bonding and training your dog go hand-in-hand. By doing both, you are building a relationship of
                respect, communication and companionship.
