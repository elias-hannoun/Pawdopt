                More than one-third (34%) of dogs were diagnosed as obese, according to the most recent data from
                Banfield Pet Hospital, which has more than 1,000 veterinary hospitals in 42 states. That's a 108%
                increase from 2011 to 2020. <br>
                Unfortunately, overweight canines are susceptible to many health risks such as metabolic abnormalities,
                cardiovascular disease or poor immune systems. While you may want to spoil your pet, avoid spoiling them
                with food.

            <ul>
                <li class="list_dog_cat_care">Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health.
                    The food you choose should
                    be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.
                </li>
                <li class="list_dog_cat_care">You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and
                    refill your cat's water bowls
                    daily.</li>
                <li class="list_dog_cat_care">Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.</li>
                <li class="list_dog_cat_care">Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not
                    feeling well Please
                    read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.
                </li>
                <li class="list_dog_cat_care">Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea,
                    vomiting or lethargy continue for
                    more than two days.</li>

                Grooming
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly.
                Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the
                incidence of hairballs.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header_3_dog_cat_care">
                Housing
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest. Line your cat's bed with a
                soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor
                cats do not live as long as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or from fights
                with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats are more
                likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious diseases.
            </p>

                Identification
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                If allowed outdoors, your cat must wear a safety collar and an ID tag. A safety collar with an elastic
                panel will allow your cat to break loose if the collar gets caught on something. And for both indoor and
                outdoor cats, an ID tag or an implanted microchip can help ensure that your cat is returned if he or she
                becomes lost.

                Health
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                Your cat should see the veterinarian at least once a year for an examination and annual shots, and
                immediately if she is sick or injured.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header_3_dog_cat_care">
                Scratching
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp,
                smooth claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat's nails every two to three weeks will keep them
                relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both humans and furniture. Provide your cat with a
                sturdy scratching post, at least three feet high. The post should also be stable enough that it won't
                wobble during use, and should be covered with rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many
                cats also like scratching pads.
            </p>

                Medicines, Poisons, and Vaccinations
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph_dog_cat_care">
                Never give your cat medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your
                animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian directly. <br>
                Your veterinarian will make recommendations based on your cat's age and health.
